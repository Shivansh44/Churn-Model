# Churn-Model
This project centres around breaking down the churn forecast methods to distinguish the churn conduct and approve the explanations behind client churn.
Using Artificial Neural Networks and machine learning models, we analysed data accurately so that we can predict the probability of the churn. The details filled in by the user are used as inputs for the training
model. So, based on these user inputs, we can predict whether the customer leaves the membership or not.
